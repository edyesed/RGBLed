# RGBLed
This is a very minimal Arduino Nano + RGB led circuit. 

If you make this circuit and load the corresponding [python bit](github.com/edyesed/led-webserver), then you can have a RGBLed with an http interface on your local computer.

Some people ( not all ) think that sort of thing is neat. 

# Create the circuit
[Circuit Diagram located here](./led_webserver_diagram.pdf)

# Load the sketch to the Arduino
See [RGBLed.cpp](./RGBLed.cpp) 

# Run the python HTTP API 
You can find that at [github.com/edyesed/led-webserver](https://github.com/edyesed/led-webserver).

Once you start it, you have a RGBLed with an http interface on your local computer.

Cool, right?
